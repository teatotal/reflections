What happens when you initialise a repository?
    - Using 'Git Init' allows you to create a repository out of your files.
    - You need to do this so you can commit files in the future.
    - 'Git status' lets you see the status of the repository. I.e. when the last commit was etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory?
    - The staging area is part of git whereas the working directory is more of a snapshot of your own file directory
    - The staging area seems like a virtual holding area of the items you want to commit.
What value does the staging area offer?
    - It provides a virtual environment to hold files whilst you're working on other files before commiting.
    - This can be extremely useful if you're not yet ready to do the whole commit but know you wont be making other changes to that single file.
