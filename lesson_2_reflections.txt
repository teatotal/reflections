What happens when you initialise a repository?
    - Using 'Git Init' allows you to create a repository out of your files.
    - You need to do this so you can commit files in the future.
    - 'Git status' lets you see the status of the repository. I.e. when the last commit was etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory?
    - The staging area is part of git whereas the working directory is more of a snapshot of your own file directory
    - The staging area seems like a virtual holding area of the items you want to commit.
What value does the staging area offer?
    - It provides a virtual environment to hold files whilst you're working on other files before commiting.
    - This can be extremely useful if you're not yet ready to do the whole commit but know you wont be making other changes to that single file.


COMMITING:

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
    - You can see what files are waiting to be commited and can check if it makes sense or not

BRANCHES:

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organised?
    - Great when you want two versions of the programme e.g. different difficulties, languages etc.

How do branches help?
    - Branches allow you to have access to both versions and be able to fix bugs without needing to fix bugs in two separate pieces of code

How do diagrams help you visualise the branch structure?
    - Diagrams help you see what commits can and can't be accessed and whether a new branch may be a better option

MERGING:

What is the result of merging two branches together?
    - Merges all the commits from both branches with all changes and arranges them all via timestamp

Pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs always doing it manually?
    PROS: - Saves time when merges are obvious
          - Commits without having to wait until you've hear back from collaborators etc.
          - Luckily doesn't automatically commit everything
    CONS: - Could potentially do an automatic commit and cause a bug/overwrite data
